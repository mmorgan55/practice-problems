# practice-problems

## The reason for this repository is for me to keep my answers to programming problems in one place, such as those from sites like
CodeWars, CodeSignal, Hackerrank etc. All the files will have non-descriptive names so that this repository won't show up in search 
results. Not trying to give away answers.
